# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Analyze this repository for the Res+ emergency coordination platform. Read TECH_STACK.md and FLOW.md as the source of truth. Do not implement features yet. First: 1. Inspect the existing repository. 2. Determine what is already implemented. 3. Identify missing dependencies and configuration. 4. Propose the folder structure. 5. Define the minimum viable hackathon architecture. 6. Identify the critical user journeys: Household, BHW, Ambulance, ER. 7. Identify external integrations that require API keys. 8. Create an implementation plan ordered by dependency. Do not change the core flow described in FLOW.md. Prioritize a working end-to-end demo over production-scale architecture.
